# Requirements
  You will need to provide a working prototype of the application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. There is no need at all for you to take older browsers into account.
  The minimum requirements are:
  ● Users should be able to browse through the movies of the week using infinite scrolling
  ● Users should be able to search for movies by typing into a textbox and then browse through the results using infinite scrolling
  ● Users should be able to click on a movie to view more info about it. Clicking on it should expand (feel free to interpret “expand” into an animation of your liking) the item to fit the extra information while clicking on it again should return it to its normal state.
  
  # Assumptions and choices
     Emphasise images over text
     Use somewhat big images of the provided sizes
     Null images will occupy space for uniformity
     Use simple layout for "more info"
     Use "star" rating instead of retrieved numerical
     Try to minimise empty space
     No max width restrictions
